## Meeting details

### Game 1: Fox and hound

A nice high energy game to get them started

* Divide the beavers into two teams. Use the "Tallest to smallest" technique to form two evenly matched teams
* One team is declared to be hounds and the other are foxes
* Foxes wear a "tail" which is a kneckerchief or tee towel hanging from the back of the belt
* Foxes become "hounds" if they lose their tail
* When there are no more "foxes" swap over

### Activity 1: Skittle hunt (ice breaker)

* Form the beavers into 4 groups. Again use the "Tallest to smallest" technique
* Each beaver gets a random skittle
* When Scouter in charge says go they must find another beaver in a different group who has the same color skittle
* Each pair of beavers must find something they have in common with each other (Same color eyes, go to same school,...)
* If they succeed they must annouce it to a Scouter and then they get to eat the skittles
* Repeat a number of times to ensure the beavers make lots of other beavers with similar interests ... Or when you run out of skittles!!!

### Game 2

No See Em's Game.

* Split group into two teams by forming a line (Tallest to smallest) and numbering off (1,2,1,2...). This will take some time which is fine as they get to know one another
* Have two adults hold a tarp or blanket up and split the group into two teams, one on each side of the tarp (or blanket). Ideally, each
team will also have at least one adult helping it (or the adults
holding the tarp will help). 
* Each team sends a team member to stand next to the tarp. On the count of three, the tarp is lowed and each Cub at the tarp (without any help from others) must name the other Cub
* The Cub who is idenitifed first joins the other team. The game is played until the adult leader decides to stop or until all Cubs are on the same team.
* This is a great way to help Cubs (and Scouter's) to learn Cubâ€™s names.

### Activity 2: Remembering the last beaver year

* Form the beaver colony into a circle
* Ask the beavers to remember what they did last year. Adults allowed to prompt
* This is a good opportunity for the beavers to remember what went well and whether they want to do it again
