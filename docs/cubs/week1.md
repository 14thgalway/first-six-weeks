## Meeting details

### Game 1

Call up the older sizers that are present and allow them to decide the game to be played. Encourage a high energy option

Example: Rock, Paper, Scissors tag

* Ensure everyone knows how to play rock,paper,scissors
* Game starts out as a classic tag, everyone runs around until they are tagged or tag. i
* Each pairing will then begin a game of rock,paper,scissors. The winner gets to run away and tag another player, the loser must sit down
* Each cub sitting down must keep an eye on the cub that beat them. If that cubs later loses a game of rocker,paper,scissors then they get to stand up and run away
* Continue until a suitable amount of time has elaspsed or there is only one cub standing

### Activity 1: Getting to know you (ice breaker)

Two truths and a lie.

* Get the group to sit in a circle and ask one person to say two truths and a lie about themselves.
* After they have finished you, as a compere, must get the group to vote on which statement they think is a lie.
* If the majority get it wrong, the player goes again, but if they get it right, play moves on to the next player.

### Game 2

No See Em's Game.

* Split group into two teams by forming a line (Tallest to smallest) and numbering off (1,2,1,2...). This will take some time which is fine as they get to know one another
* Have two adults hold a tarp or blanket up and split the group into two teams, one on each side of the tarp (or blanket). Ideally, each
team will also have at least one adult helping it (or the adults
holding the tarp will help). 
* Each team sends a team member to stand next to the tarp. On the count of three, the tarp is lowed and each Cub at the tarp (without any help from others) must name the other Cub
* The Cub who is idenitifed first joins the other team. The game is played until the adult leader decides to stop or until all Cubs are on the same team.
* This is a great way to help Cubs (and Scouter's) to learn Cubâ€™s names.

### Activity 2: Remembering the last cub year

* Form the cub pack into a circle
* Ask the cubs to remember what the cub pack did last year. Adults allowed to prompt
* This is a good opportunity to wish the older cubs goodbye and also an opportunity for the cubs to remember what went well and whether they want to do it again

### Horseshoe and cub howl

The cubs gather in a semi-circle we call the horseshoe

* Opportunity for Scouter in charge to make any annoucements about upcoming events and answer questions
* The cub howl, sometimes called the grand howl is an old cub tradition. Try and get an older cub to do it or even ask a gang of cubs who are leaving for scouts.
* Be aware that some cubs don't like loud noises, so invite them to step aware from the horseshoe and cover their ears if they want.
