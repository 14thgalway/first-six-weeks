### Opening ceremony

Beaver promise

```
Beaver Scouts Promise:
I promise to do my best,
to be a good Beaver Scout,
to love the world, and
to love one another.
```

### Game 1: Fox and hound

A nice high energy game to get them started

* Divide the beavers into two teams. Use the "Tallest to smallest" technique to form two evenly matched teams
* One team is declared to be hounds and the other are foxes
* Foxes wear a "tail" which is a kneckerchief or tee towel hanging from the back of the belt
* Foxes become "hounds" if they lose their tail
* When there are no more "foxes" swap over
