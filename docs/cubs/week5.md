Scout promise

```
On my honour,
I promise to do my best,
To uphold my Scouting principals,
To serve my community,
To help other people
And to keep the (cub) scout law
```

### Game 1: Snowballs

* This game is played in 4 sixes. 
* Each six gets a quadrant of the hall to defend.
* Each six gets a collection (10?) of rolled up newspaper, which we call a "snowball"
* The cubs will throw their snowballs into the other three quadrants. The objective is to have the least number of snowballs when the Scouter in charge shouts "stop".
